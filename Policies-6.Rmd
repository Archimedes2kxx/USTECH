## Overview   

Kurosawa's classic film  [<b>Rashomon</b>](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/) challenged its viewers to puzzle over what they had seen. Four versions of a tragic event were presented, but each version had enough omissions and inconsistencies to alert the viewer that no version was the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Even the supposedly neutral observer framed his version in a way to make himself look better. Some viewers concluded that the film's main point was that truth is unknowable. I'm not so pessimistic. To me the film is a reminder that truth is attainable but is rarely as simple as it first appears to be, and that multiple perspectives provide useful insights, even when they seem to be in conflict with each other.   

The four viewpoints presented in the following sections of this analysis are the perspectives that I encountered in my efforts to assemble extensive body of statistical data that could provide a broad context for productive discussions of diversity in the U.S. information technology sector. As in the movie, the four viewpoints are presented as short vignettes, but each vignette contains links to other reports that provide more extensive discussions.

The tragic event that happened in the movie was a brutal rape ... or was it a shocking act of consensual infidelity??? ... This analysis will show that the tragic event that happened in the U.S. information technology sector was gender and racial bias in the hiring of women and minorities ... or was it the inadequate supply of qualified women and minorities??? ... or was it the shocking emergence of larger factors that substantially impeded the impact of all policies designed to increase the diversity of employment in the U.S. tech sector???

## Version 1 -- Racism and Sexism   

<b>Problem: Low percentage of women, Blacks, and Hispanics in U.S. tech</b>   
The nation's attention was focused on this problem in 2014 by the responses of Google, Facebook, and other major Silicon Valley tech firms to repeated requests from the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Jr., for the employment data in their annual EEOC reports. As was widely anticipated, the data showed that the percentage of women, Blacks, and Hispanics employed by these firms was well below the percentage of these groups in the nation's overall population. Every year since 2014, prominent companies in the Valley have issued diversity reports, most of which shown little or no progress, i.e., no substantial increases in the percentage of women, Blacks, and Hispanics on their technical staffs.

DATA DATA DATA... provide links to diversity reports and EEOC report ...

Although Silican Valley is arguably the most important center of information technology in the U.S., it is not the only center. Diversity reports about the Valley are important, but they do not provide reliable indicators of the participation of women, Blacks, and Hispanics in the entire U.S. tech sector. That's why I used U.S. Census data to develop estimates of the participation of these groups in the tech sectors of all fifty states plus the District of Columbia using data for 2010 and 2015: 

* [<b>Best States for American Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Female Tech – Vers 1.0f</b>](https://hbcu-levers.blogspot.com/2016/11/best-states-for-american-black-hispanic.html)    

<i>Note: The reader is reminded that the existence of discrimination against women and minorities in the workplace is usually provided by (1) data that shows that few women and minorities are employed and/or (2) data that shows that women and minority employees do not receive compensation that is equal to the compensation received by men and non-minorities who have comparable education and experience. My own reports and most of the reports produced by the EEOC and by the Silicon Valley employers focused on the number of women and minorities employed. The third and fourth viewpoints discussed in this analysis will refer to compensation.</i>

The following tables show that Blacks and Hispanic techs enjoyed more substantial employment opportunities outside of California in 2015, but confirm that female techs only represented 20 to 30 percent of the employees in the tech sectors of most states in 2015 .

DATA DATA DATA Table 4B (Black American) ... Table 4D (Hispanic American) ... Table 4E (Asian American -- no bias) ... Table 4F (Non-Asian American)



<b>Cause: Racial and gender bias</b>   
The low percentages of women, Blacks, and Hispanics employed by Silicon Valley's leading employers was interpreted as indications of racial and gender bias in hiring processes

<b>Solutions: diversity/inclusion officers and diverse board members</b>  
Advocates demanded that diversity/inclusion officers be added to the human relations departments of the Valley's firms. THese officers would be charged with hiring more women and minoritieis. Adding diverse members to the boards of these firms would provide the required high level oversight to ensure that the diversity initiatives produced substantial results

## Version 2  -- Academic Pipelines   

<b>Problem: low percentage of women, Blacks, and Hispanics in tech</b>   
Some of the leadership of Silicon Valley viewed the same  EEOC data, but came to very different conclusions and different solutions than the Reverend Jackson and his associates

<b>Cause: low enrollments of women, Blacks, and Hispanics in academic pipelines</b> 
The Valley's leadership claimed that the low employment levels reflected  low enrollment levels of women, Blacks, and Hispanics in computer science and related college degree programs that led to careers in information technology. They also observed that the low enrollment levels in college programs reflected low enrollments in high school and middle school courses that stimulated young people's interests in computer science and related fields

<b>Solutions: Specialized college recruitment and support for K-12 programs </b>
Goggle and others tried to fill the academic pipelines by intensifying their recruitment of Black students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). And many companies offered support for Black Girls Code, Code.org, and other organizations that ran programs that stimulate interest in computer sceience among K-12 students.  .. While Code.org is justly proud of the high participation levels of women and minorities in its "Hour of Code" and other workshops, its most substantial achievement has been to persuade an ever increasing array of governors, mayors, and school superintendents to introduce computer science courses for credit towards graduation in high schools and middle schools all over the country. These course will be taught by the same well-intentioned teachers who have failed to provide adequate instruction in math and science for millions of Black students. So we should anticipate the emergence of a computer science skills gaps comparble to the well documented math and science skills gaps between blacks, Hispanics, and whites and Asians

DATA DATA DATA DATA ... my data about Black, Hispanic enrollments in top schools, espe in California 

Flaw -- lots of Black and Hispanic techs, SV has small demand, why no recruitment efforts??? Why no concern about competitive disadvantages of low diversity??

## ... Comments -- Versions 1 and 2

* Little progress in Silicon Valley and the "explanation" of apologists "These things take time" is both ironic and unacceptable give the Valley's incessant self-praise about its capacity to "disrupt" and "fail fast"  

* My initial focus was on Black Techs, but my examination of data that showed substantial enrollments of Hispanic students in California's top schools removed all doubt that lack of employment in Silicon Valley was a reflection of of low supply levels in the Valley's pipelines

* Lack of progress suggest that neither perspective gets to the heart of the issue. Failure sometimes indicates that other actions of the actor are acting at cross purposes to the actor's stated goals   

* By the time I finished "Best States" I had acquired enough data about U,S, tech's extensive hiring of foreign techs to suspect that the increasing employment of these high tech migrant laborers might be the "cross purposes" initiative resopnsible for the lack of progress   

* As an aging Black techie who received his undergrad degree in engineering way back in 1962 from New York University, I find racial bias, conscious or unconscious, as implausible explanations of the Valley's lack of progress in increasing the percentage of Black technical staff on the Valley's payrolls. Why? Because there are too many Jewish Americans in the top management of the Valley's biggest and most successful companies.

## Version 3 -- Competitive Advantage  


Problem: Not enough U.S. techs with satisfactory tech skills   
Cause: Curriculum of U.S. colleges and universities not evolving fast enough to keep pace with evolving technologies required by U.S. tech   
Solution: import increasing numbers of foreign professionals to fill this skills gap, especially from Asia where training seems to be keeping pace with technology and cost of living is lower than in Europe, expand H-1B visa, ... broad scale immigration reform to give U.S. tech access to unlimited foreign labor   
Flaw -- Why is there no limit to foreign recruitment?   

DATA... DATA ... DATA ... my data about foreign, including maps and charts

<P style="page-break-before: always">   
## Version 4 -- Maximum Profits   

DATA ... refer to same data about foreign

Problem: U.S. Tech, especially software development, is still labor intensive   
In order to sustain record profits in order to attract future investments, labor costs must be reduced   
Classic solution -- use cheaper labor, i.e., techs from other countries with much lower standards of living, e.g, therefore mostly from Asian countriess   
Flaw -- Japan that can say no ... defense industrial base ... cost benefit for entire economy ... permanent low share for Black techs can't compete with cheap labor
