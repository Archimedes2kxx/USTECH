## Roy's R Style Guide    

* Capitalize the first letter of names of all groups everywhere, e.g., Black, White, Asian, Hispanic ... use same names in Data and Stat files as in Report files
* Capitalize first letter of names of larger groupings, e.g, Pop, Tech as in Black.Pop, Asian.Tech
* Include row names in all tables
* Impose minimal formatting in the Data-1A, Data-1B. and Stats-2 modules
* Impose most formatting in the chunks in the Report-3 markdown just before printing
* Save the row names in the markdown chunks before printing
* Restore the row names in the markdown in the same chunks after printing
* Only save dfTables ... e.g. dfTable1A/B, dfTable2A/B, etc ... don't save other versions
* Cite numbers in markdown text via row and column names in the tables; do not use row or column numbers
* Otherwise follow Google's Style Guide for R 
... including use dots instead of underscores in variable names, e.g, per.Black.Tech
... including lower case for all other variables and identifiers (other than groups and larger groups)
