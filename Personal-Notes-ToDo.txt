To Do List

1. Revise Notes to delete use of Fact Finder ... all data from DataFerret now

2. Note describing breaking scripts into small segments to minimize to give focus to each segment and minimize damage caused by accidental changes in code ... putting functions into library will reduce damage by accidental key slips

3. Note describing future version that would compare state distribution of all groups in 2010 vs state distribution of groups in 2015

4. Data-1A, 1B, and Stats-2A contain lots of ugly, repetitive junk code ... extract functions and place functions in the functions-0 library ==> clean scripts

Functions
    a) Add total col ... DONE
    b) Add percentage columns ... DONE
    c) Add top row sums and or percentages ... DONE
    d) Revise Stats-2A to functions + scripts ==> Tables 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B as before
        Tables 3 series 
        Create year-to-year change in profile, e.g., 2010 to 2015 
        Hispanic, Female ==>  count2010, count2015, Change, perChange ... DONE
        
        Profiles #1 - A All, B Black, C White, D Hispanic, E Asian, F Foreign Asian, G Foreign NonAsian
        Occupation, Tech15, TS_%, Fem, Per15 ... DONE
        
        Profiles #2 - AA, BB, CC, DD, EE, Ff, GG
        Occupation, Tech10, Tech15, Change, PerChange, PerF10 ... DONE
        
    e) Revise Data-1 and Data-2 to Data-1 with large function + small script ... DONE
        ==> Read census data to create initial tables for given year and citizen status 
        ...  e.g. techs in 2010, techs in 2015, workforce in 2010, workforce in 2015, foreign techs in 2010 ...Code is Done
5) Change color of maps ... all states below 10% = vague, above 10% = inceasingly vivid ... DONE
6) Revise questions
7) Link tables to revised questions
8) Revise text of report
    a) Overview
    b) Questions about Tables 1 & 2
    c) Questions about Tables 3
    c) Questions about Tables 4, 5
    d) Questions about Tables 6
    e) Questions about Tables 7
    f) Questions about Tables 8
    g) Questions about Final Comments
    h) Text about motivation 
    i) Text about Methods
9) Revise supplementary fies of GitHub
    a) Readme
    b) Notes about Codes
    c) Notes about other stuff
    
    
5. Version 2.0 
Interactive version, Shiny app, that displays  profiles of each state for each group (white, black, asian, hispanic, female, foreign asian, foreign non-asian) for 2010 or 2015 … then calculates changes, percent changes for focal group … interactive, i.e, tables generated real time. Need more extensive Census samples because current data yields missing values for more in-depth analysis

6. Future reports ... Best States for Black, Hispanic, Asian, female ==> doctors, lawyers, engineers, physical sciences, biosciences, etc, etc, etc
