This repo contains the data files, code books, and R code required to produce the tables, maps, graphs, and stats included in the "Best States for Blacks and Hispanics in Tech" report and its supplement. It also contains the R-markdown code that generated the report and knitr's conversion of the markdown to an HTML format. In other words, the repo should contain all of the resources required to make the report "reproducible" for anyone interested in replicating its findings and/or extending them to other states, adding/deleting variables, comparing them to census data from previous time frames, etc, etc, etc.

The scripts and embedded functions should be loaded in numerical order ==> functions-0 then Data-1.R The Data-1 module creates the data frames required by Stats-2A.R, Stats-2B.R, and Stats-2C.R. The Stats modules create the tables, maps, graphs, and regressions required by the R-markdown script in the Report-3.Rmd file that generates the report.

The repo contains a "Notes-" file that provides a detailed click-by-click description of my download procedure for obtaining the data for the Data-1B.R script via the Data Ferret.

When running these scripts, all programs and data files should be in the same working directory.
